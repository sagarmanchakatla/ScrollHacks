What is car insurance?


Car Insurance policy is a contract between the car owner and the insurance company. The owner pays a premium to the insurer in exchange for coverage and compensation in case of accidents or specific events. A car insurance policy has been mandated in India by the Motor Vehicles Act of 1988.There are three major types of four-wheeler insurance policies – comprehensive, own damage, and third-party policies. A third-party insurance policy covers damages or injuries caused to a third-person or their property. An own damage policy only covers damages sustained by the insured car. Finally, a comprehensive policy covers both own damage and third-party liabilities.

Car insurance is a crucial financial safeguard for drivers, offering protection in the face of unforeseen accidents or mishaps on the road. Today’s digital age has made buying car insurance online an easy and convenient method for many. You can compare quotes from various providers, customise coverage options, and make secure transactions from the comfort of your home.

Factors affecting car insurance premiums

Four-wheeler insurance is an essential investment for car owners to protect themselves and their vehicles from financial losses caused by accidents or theft. However, the amount of insurance premium depends on several factors. Let's examine some of the essential factors that affect car insurance premium to help you make an informed decision.

Car's engine capacity

The higher the engine capacity of the car, the higher the car insurance premium will be.


Insurance coverage

The type and extent of insurance coverage you choose will affect the premium. Comprehensive car insurance policy comes with a higher premium than third-party car insurance.


Insured Declared Value (IDV)

The IDV is the maximum amount you can receive as compensation if your car gets damaged beyond repair. The higher the IDV, the higher the premium will be.


Cost of add-ons

Car insurance policy usually comes with add-ons such as zero depreciation cover, engine protector, etc. Add-ons increase the premium cost.


Age of the car

The older the car, the lower the premium will be as the IDV decreases with age.


Claims history

The higher the number of claims made in the past, the higher the premium will be for car insurance renewal.


Deductibles

A deductible is the amount agreed upon to be borne by the policyholder in case of a claim. The higher the deductible, the lower the premium.

Geographical location

The city and state where the car is used will also affect the premium due to the differences in the risk of accidents, theft, etc.

How to calculate car insurance premiums ?

Four-wheeler insurance premiums in India are calculated based on several factors such as vehicle type, engine capacity, age of the vehicle, location, and the type of coverage. Here are some steps to calculate car insurance premiums in India:


Determine the Insured Declared Value (IDV) of your car

IDV is the current market value of your car, after adjusting for depreciation. It is the maximum amount that can be claimed in case of theft or total damage to your car. You can use IDV calculators available online or consult with your car insurance online provider to determine the IDV of your car.


Determine the type of coverage

The two types of coverage are Third-Party Liability and Comprehensive insurance. Third-party insurance is mandatory by law, covering only third-party liabilities, while comprehensive insurance covers both third-party liabilities and own damage to your vehicle.


Calculate the premium

Premiums are calculated based on different factors. For instance, third-party premiums are fixed by the regulator, while own damage premiums vary based on the Insured Declared Value, IDV, add-ons, and the make and model of the car. Use premium calculators provided by insurers or consult with them to calculate the annual premium of your car insurance policy.


Determine the add-ons

Add-ons are additional coverage options that can be purchased along with your primary insurance policy. These include roadside assistance, personal accident cover, engine protection, zero depreciation, and others. They increase the total cost of your policy but also increase the coverage offered.


Claim history

A car insurance company considers various factors while determining the premium of a policy, which includes the claim history of the car owner. If a person has a history of making claims frequently, then the insurance company may increase the premium of the policy as they consider the person as a high-risk driver. So, it is advisable to drive responsibly and make claims only when necessary to maintain a good claim history and keep the car insurance premium affordable.


Fuel type

Your four-wheeler insurance premium also depends on the fuel type – diesel or petrol. Cars running on diesel have higher premiums than petrol-driven cars.


Location

The premium amount also depends on the location where you stay and mostly the areas with a higher risk of theft, or accidents have a higher premium.


Year of car manufacturing

Cars manufactured in the latest year will require a higher premium compared to the older ones as the price of the car and parts are higher.


Third-party car insurance premium

Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) sets the third-party insurance premium based on the car engine’s cubic capacity. Here’s a quick look at the latest third-party car insurance premium.

Engine CC

	

Third-party car insurance premium




Up to 1,000 CC

	

Rs. 2,094




1,000 – 1,500 CC

	

Rs. 3,416




Above 1,500 CC

	

Rs. 7,897


In summary, car insurance premiums in India are calculated based on various factors such as Insured Declared Value (IDV), type of coverage, and add-ons, but may vary from insurance provider to provider. You can use online premium calculators or consult with your insurance provider to determine the best policy for you and your vehicle.

How to save on car insurance premium ?

Four-wheeler insurance premiums can be a significant expense for car owners. However, there are ways to lower the premiums without compromising on the insurance coverage. Here are some effective ways to reduce car insurance premium:


Compare insurance policies

Comparing car insurance policies from different insurers will help you choose the best insurance policy with a lower premium.


Opt for voluntary deductibles

Choosing a higher voluntary deductible will reduce the car insurance premium.


Drive safely

Safe driving habits like following traffic rules, avoiding distractions, and driving within speed limits can reduce the risk of accidents and, in turn, lower the insurance premium.


Avoid making small claims

Avoid filing for small claims as every claim made will increase insurance premium cost.


Choose the right coverage

Choosing the right insurance coverage for the car, like comprehensive insurance, depending on the car's age, will result in a lower premium.

Renew insurance on time

Failing to renew the car insurance policy on time leads to higher premiums. Timely renewal of four-wheeler insurance policies is important.

Types of car insurance policies

There are primarily four types of four-wheeler insurance policies, each designed to address the varying needs of the customers and the best coverage they need:

Comprehensive insurance

A comprehensive car insurance policy covers the damages caused both to the insured car and the third party. It covers the damages caused due to theft, fire, malicious activity, or a natural calamity or accident. Comprehensive car insurance is your all-in-one safety net on the road. With this policy, your vehicle is shielded from life's unexpected twists, providing peace of mind and comprehensive protection for your precious wheels in any situation. A comprehensive insurance policy is considered as the ideal insurance cover for your car since it offers all-round protection against own and third-party damages. It also offers the option of adding add-on covers.

Third-Party Insurance

Third-party car insurance is mandatory in India and covers the damage caused by your car to other people's vehicles and property. However, it will not cover the damages to your car if you are at fault. A third-party car insurance is the essential guardian for responsible drivers. It's a legal necessity that ensures you cruise the roads with confidence and financial responsibility. A third-party insurance plan is relatively cheaper to afford than a comprehensive cover and it also doesn’t offer the option to buy add-on covers.

Own damage insurance

An own damage car insurance covers you against any accidental damages to your four-wheeler. It offers coverage in case your car is damaged due to natural disasters, like flood or earthquake. It also offers coverage for man-made disasters, such as theft, damages due to riot, etc. You can buy car insurance policy online if you already have an active third-party vehicle insurance policy. This combination will ensure you get complete coverage for your vehicle. If you already have a third-party insurance policy, you can opt for a standalone own damage policy instead of a comprehensive policy. This will help save on premiums without compromising on coverage.

Zero dep car insurance

Zero dep or zero depreciation car insurance is a type of insurance policy that guarantees full settlement of the insurance claim without any deduction for depreciation. This four-wheeler insurance policy covers the entire cost of repair and replacement of car parts damaged in an accident without any loss in value. It is especially beneficial for cars that are new or have a high market value. If you wish to get complete coverage for your car while negating the impact of depreciation, a zero depreciation car insurance is ideal.

Difference between third-party, own damage and comprehensive car insurance

Based on your specific needs and circumstances, you can choose any one of comprehensive insurance, third-party insurance, and own damage insurance Here are the major differences between the three:

Features


	

Comprehensive insurance

	

Third-party insurance

	

Own damage insurance




Coverage

	

Covers both third-party liability and damage to your own vehicle

	

Only covers third-party liabilities

	

Only covers the insured (own) vehicle




Premium cost

	

Higher premiums due to higher coverage

	

Cheaper than comprehensive insurance plan due to limited coverage

	

Cheaper than comprehensive insurance but higher than third-party insurance




Add-on cover

	

Provides additional benefits such as personal accident cover, towing service, roadside assistance, loss of personal baggage, etc

	

No additional benefits are available in third-party car insurance

	

Enables plan customisations by adding add-on covers like roadside assistance, engine protection cover, personal accident cover, key replacement cover, etc.




Mandatory requirement

	

Optional but highly recommended

	

Compulsory for all car owners in India

	

Optional, can be bought if you already have a third-party insurance.


A third-party insurance only covers third-party liabilities, while comprehensive insurance provides wider coverage for both third-party liability and loss or damage to your own vehicle. And in case you already have a third-party insurance in place and would like to get coverage for your own vehicle, you may consider buying an own damage insurance.

Available add-ons in car insurance policy

Here are some of the add-on covers available with four-wheeler insurance policies.


Zero depreciation cover

Also known as a bumper-to-bumper cover, with the zero-depreciation add-on, you can nullify the depreciation factored in during claim settlement. In this cover, you receive the full claim amount as mentioned in the Bajaj car insurance policy documents initially. Also, it covers the depreciation of the value of spare parts.

Engine protection cover

A standard car insurance plan does not cover the expenses incurred due to engine damage. The engine protector add-on helps you save up to 40% of the amount you would spend on getting your car’s engine fixed.

Key and lock assistance

The key and lock assistance add-on helps reduce the costs of replacing or repairing missing or damaged keys. Car insurance covers not just the car key but the entire locking system.

Compulsory personal accident cover

Personal accident cover for the owner and driver is available as an add-on benefit. So, if you suffer injuries due to an accident while driving your car, the insurer will pay up the amount mentioned in the defined cover.

Roadside assistance cover

This is one of the most useful four-wheeler insurance add-ons. You can get a tyre changed, have an expert look into your car’s engine, or more with just a call or a click, 24x7.


Consumables cover

Consumable items of a car include nuts and bolts, screws, washers, grease, lubricants, and related parts. The basic car insurance policy does not cover such consumable items. However, a consumables add-on cover will cover any expenses arising out of damage or loss to these parts.

No Claim Bonus protection cover

This add-on cover allows you to retain your NCB even after making a claim during the four-wheeler insurance policy period. It helps protect your accumulated NCB and reduces the premium cost at the time of policy renewal.

Pay as you drive cover

Pay as You Drive (PAYD) cover is a usage-based policy that calculates the premium based on the number of kilometres driven by the policyholder. The idea behind this type of cover is to provide a customised premium to people who do not drive frequently. This car insurance provides flexibility and helps save a significant amount on the insurance premium.

Return to invoice cover

Return to invoice cover is an add-on cover that helps you get the claim amount equal to the invoice value. In case of theft or total loss of the car, the RTI cover will provide the full invoice price of the car, including road tax and registration fees.

Driver and passenger cover

Driver and passenger cover is an add-on cover that provides coverage against accidental injuries of the driver and passengers. 

Tyre protection cover

Tyre protection cover offers coverage against damages or expenses incurred due to tyre damages. This car insurance add-on covers the cost of tyre repair or replacement in case of damages caused by nails, bursting, punctures, or cuts.

Legal liability to paid driver

This add-on cover provides coverage against legal liabilities arising from injuries or death caused to a paid driver while driving the car. It is beneficial for car owners who employ a driver for their vehicles.


Personal baggage cover

This add-on cover provides coverage against loss or damage to personal belongings kept in the car. It is particularly helpful when carrying expensive personal belongings in the car.


Conveyance benefit

This add-on cover compensates for the expenses incurred by the insured person during the repair of the insured car. It is helpful when the car is undergoing repairs for an extended period.


24x7 spot assistance

This add-on cover provides assistance for emergencies such as tire puncture, breakdown, or fuel shortage. It is a significant benefit for car owners traveling long distances or in remote areas.

Factors affecting Insured Declared Value (IDV )

Insured Declared Value (IDV) is a crucial aspect of car insurance that determines the maximum payout in case of theft or total loss of the vehicle. Here are some factors that influence the IDV of a car:

Age of the car

As a car ages, its value decreases, and thus the IDV decreases too.

Make and model

Cars that are expensive or have a higher resale value will have a higher IDV than those that are less expensive.

Usage of the car

If a car is used for commercial purposes, the IDV may be higher than if it is used for personal use only.

Geographical location

Cars that are kept in areas with a high risk of theft or damage may have a lower IDV.

Safety features and modifications

Cars with better safety features and modifications may have a higher IDV.

It's important to consider these factors while choosing car insurance coverage. By understanding the factors that affect the IDV, you can make an informed decision and choose appropriate coverage that aligns with your car's value.

Here’s a quick overview of the car’s depreciation value to estimate the IDV.
