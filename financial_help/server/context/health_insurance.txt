Does your health insurance policy cover COVID-19 treatment?

Yes, most medical insurance plans now include coverage for COVID-19 treatment, addressing the rising healthcare needs during the pandemic. These policies typically cover hospitalisation, medication, and post-treatment expenses related to COVID-19. It's crucial to review the specifics of your policy to understand the extent of coverage. With the evolving nature of the pandemic, insurers have adapted their medical insurance plans to ensure comprehensive protection against the financial burden of COVID-19 treatment.

Factors that affect your health insurance premium

Health insurance premiums are calculated based on several factors. These include the age of the insured, type of plan, sum insured, habits and lifestyle, and medical history. The older you are, the higher your premium is likely to be, as the risk of mortality, hospitalisation, and medical expenses increases with age. The type of plan you choose, such as an individual policy or a family floater plan, also affects your premium. Here are some of the factors that affect the insurance premium.

Medical history

Every insurance provider considers the applicant's and sometimes family's medical history. Before getting health insurance, you must report any pre-existing conditions. This determines the insurer's coverage and premium.
To receive coverage for pre-existing diseases without a waiting period, you can pay more or buy an add-on.

Age

Age affects premiums for health insurance policies. Younger applicants have to pay less, and premiums increase as the age increases. For instance, someone over 50 years may need significant coverage due to heart, blood pressure, or serious sickness. In such cases, the premium will also get higher.

Lifestyle

Your lifestyle choices could significantly affect how much you pay for your health insurance. This is because you become more susceptible to lifestyle disorders like obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.

Type of health insurance chosen

The coverages of various types of health insurance plans, such as individual and family health insurance policies, vary. Hence, the range of coverages you select will determine your premium.

No claim bonus

Check your health insurance plan's No Claim Bonus (NCB) before renewing. You can receive a no-claim bonus of up to 50% for each year you do not make a claim. This amount reduces your coverage or premium.

How to choose the best health insurance plan in 2024?

Here are some tips to choose the best health insurance plans for you and your family.

Analyse the plan type

Understand your requirement, whether you need an individual health insurance or a health insurance for family.

Coverage details

Based on these requirements, choose a health insurance that fits your requirements.
