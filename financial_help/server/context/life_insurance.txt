What is life insurance?

Life insurance is a financial contract where an individual pays regular premiums to an insurance company in exchange for a sum of money (death benefit) to be paid to their beneficiaries upon their death. It provides financial security and support to loved ones in the event of the policyholder's passing, helping cover expenses like funeral costs, debts, and living expenses. Life insurance comes in various forms, including term life, whole life, and universal life policies, offering different features and benefits to policyholders.

How does life insurance work?

Here’s how a life insurance policy works:

Purchase policy: Individuals first need to buy the life insurance policy.
Pay premiums: The insured needs to pay regular premiums to the insurer.
Risk assessment: Insurer evaluates factors like age, health, and lifestyle.
Activate policy: Approved policy becomes active, offering coverage.
Policyholder's demise: If the policyholder dies, beneficiaries file a claim.
Claim approval: Valid claims are processed by the insurer.
Beneficiary payout: Tax-free death benefit is paid to beneficiaries.
Understanding how life insurance works with an example

Life insurance plans offer financial protection to your family in case of your untimely death. For example, a 30-year-old policyholder buys a 20-year life insurance plan with a sum insured of Rs. 1 crore and pays annual life insurance premiums of Rs. 15,000. If the policyholder dies during the term, their family receives Rs. 1 crore, ensuring financial stability. If the policyholder survives the term, they may receive maturity benefits, depending on the policy type. By regularly paying life insurance premiums, the policyholder ensures their family is financially secure, whether through the death cover or maturity benefits upon completing the term.

Types of life insurance

Life insurance is an integral part of financial planning and provides protection and peace of mind for individuals and their loved ones. There are several types of life insurance policies available in the market, each with its own unique features and benefits. Here are some of the most common types of life insurance policies:

1. Term life insurance

It provides coverage for a specific period of time. Generally, the most affordable type of life insurance.

2. Whole life insurance

It provides coverage for the policyholder's entire lifetime. It also offers an investment component, growing cash value over time.

3. Universal life insurance

It offers flexible coverage and premium payment options, and also allows for potential cash value accumulation.

4. Variable life insurance

Similar to whole life insurance, but policyholders have the option to invest their premiums in various investment instruments.

Who needs life insurance?
Parents: Ensure financial security for children's upbringing, education, and future.
Spouses: Protect surviving partner from financial strain upon the other's death.

Debt holders: Cover outstanding loans or mortgages to prevent burdening family with debt.
Business owners: Secure business continuity and buy-sell agreements, ensuring a smooth transition.
Single individuals: Cover end-of-life expenses and potentially leave a legacy or charitable donation.

Elderly parents: Provide for dependent parents' care and expenses, easing their financial burden.

Factors that affect life insurance premium
Age: Age is a key determinant. Premiums tend to increase as you get older since mortality risk rises with age. Younger individuals typically pay lower premiums.
Health: Your health status significantly influences premiums. Better health often results in lower premiums, while pre-existing medical conditions or unhealthy habits can lead to higher costs.

Coverage amount: The amount of coverage you choose directly affects premiums. Higher coverage means higher premiums because it represents a greater financial risk for the insurer.

Policy type: The type of policy you select, such as term life or whole life, impacts premiums. Permanent policies like whole life usually have higher premiums than term policies.

Lifestyle: Risky behaviors like smoking or dangerous hobbies can increase premiums due to higher mortality risk associated with these activities.


These factors collectively determine your life insurance premium, emphasizing the importance of considering them when purchasing coverage tailored to your financial needs and circumstances.

Points to consider before buying life insurance policy

Here are some points to keep in mind:

Assess your needs and determine how much coverage you require.
Consider the type of policy that best fits your needs and budget.

Understand the policy's riders and add-ons that can provide additional coverage.

Check if you qualify for any discounts or incentives.
Disclose all pertinent information about your health and lifestyle to the insurance provider honestly.

By considering these key points, you can select the most appropriate life insurance policy that meets your needs and goals, ensuring the financial security of your loved ones in the future.

Coverage amount: Compare the sum assured offered by different plans to ensure adequate financial protection for your family.
Premium costs: Evaluate the premium amounts and payment frequencies (annual, semi-annual, quarterly) to find a plan that fits your budget.
Policy term: Consider the duration of coverage and choose a term that aligns with your financial goals and responsibilities.
Riders and add-ons: Assess additional benefits like critical illness, accidental death, and disability riders to enhance your policy’s coverage.
Claim settlement ratio: Check the insurer’s claim settlement ratio to gauge their reliability in settling claims promptly and efficiently.
Maturity benefits: For plans with savings components, compare the maturity benefits and returns offered.
Customer reviews and ratings: Look into customer feedback and expert ratings to understand the insurer's service quality and overall reputation.
Flexibility and features: Evaluate the flexibility in policy terms, premium payment options, and features like policy loans and partial withdrawals.
Which life insurance plans come with high returns?

Following are the options of life insurance plans that come with high returns:

Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs): ULIPs combine insurance with investment, allowing policyholders to invest in equity, debt, or balanced funds. The potential for high returns is linked to market performance, making ULIPs suitable for those with a higher risk appetite.
Endowment plans: These plans offer a combination of insurance coverage and savings. They provide a lump sum on maturity or death, with guaranteed and bonus returns, making them a stable investment option with decent returns.
Money-back plans: Money-back plans provide periodic payouts during the policy term, along with a lump sum at maturity. These periodic returns, along with maturity benefits, can result in a higher overall return, especially if the insurer declares bonuses.
Participating whole life insurance plans: These plans offer coverage for the policyholder's entire life and include a savings component. The insurer declares annual bonuses, which can significantly enhance the policy's returns over time.
How much life insurance coverage do you need?

You must consider the following factors when deciding about coverage on life insurance:

Income replacement: The most suitable life insurance coverage is often 10-15 times your annual income. This ensures your family can maintain their standard of living and meet daily expenses.
Debt and liabilities: Include any outstanding debts such as home loans, car loans, and credit card balances. The coverage should be sufficient to pay off these liabilities.
Future expenses: Factor in significant future expenses like children's education and marriage. Adequate coverage should ensure these goals are met without financial strain.
Living expenses: Consider ongoing living expenses for your dependents, including household costs, healthcare, and utilities. The coverage should provide a steady income to support these needs.
Existing assets and savings: Assess your current assets and savings. Subtract these from the required coverage amount to avoid over-insuring.
Inflation adjustment: Ensure the coverage amount accounts for inflation, as costs of living and expenses will rise over time.

Regularly review your life insurance needs to ensure you have the most suitable life insurance coverage that adapts to your changing financial situation.

Importance of life insurance in different stages of life

The importance of life insurance plans varies across different stages of life, providing tailored financial security at each phase.

Young professionals: At the start of your career, life insurance plans help manage debts, like education loans, and support aging parents. Affordable term plans offer significant coverage for minimal premiums.
Newlyweds: Life insurance becomes essential as you build a future together. It ensures financial stability for your spouse, covering joint liabilities such as home loans and future family planning.
Parents: With children, life insurance plans become crucial to secure their education and upbringing. Coverage ensures your children’s future is safeguarded even in your absence.
Mid-life: As you approach retirement, life insurance helps in estate planning and managing liabilities. Whole life or endowment plans can provide a lump sum on maturity, aiding in retirement planning.
Retirees: In retirement, life insurance can cover final expenses and leave a legacy for your heirs. It ensures your loved ones are not burdened with financial stress after your passing.
What are the dos and don'ts of life insurance policies?

When considering life insurance plans, it’s essential to be aware of the dos and don’ts to make informed decisions.

Dos:
Assess your needs: Evaluate your financial responsibilities, such as debts, dependents, and future expenses, to determine the appropriate coverage.

Disclose accurate information: Provide honest and complete information about your health and lifestyle to avoid claim rejections.
Review regularly: Periodically review and adjust your coverage to ensure it aligns with changing financial circumstances and life stages.
Don’ts:
Delay purchasing: Avoid postponing buying life insurance, as premiums increase with age and health complications.
Underestimate coverage: Do not opt for insufficient coverage that may not fully protect your family’s financial future.
Ignore riders: Do not overlook additional riders that can enhance your policy, such as critical illness or accidental death benefits.
Lapse payments: Ensure timely premium payments to keep the policy active and avoid losing coverage.
Rely solely on employer coverage: Do not depend only on employer-provided life insurance, as it may not be adequate or portable if you change jobs.

Following these dos and don’ts ensures you select and maintain life insurance plans that provide comprehensive financial security for your loved ones.

What are the payout options available in life insurance?

Life insurance plans offer various payout options to suit different financial needs and preferences of policyholders and beneficiaries.

Lump sum payment: This is the most common payout option where the entire sum assured is paid to the beneficiary in one go. It provides immediate financial support for expenses like debts, funeral costs, and ongoing living expenses.
Periodic payments: Also known as annuity or income replacement plans, this option provides the sum assured in regular installments (monthly, quarterly, or annually). It ensures a steady income stream for dependents, helping them manage day-to-day expenses.
Combination of lump sum and periodic payments: Some life insurance plans offer a mix of lump sum and periodic payments. A portion of the sum assured is paid immediately, and the remaining amount is distributed as regular income. This option provides immediate financial relief and long-term income stability.
Payout with return of premium: Certain plans return the premiums paid if the policyholder outlives the policy term. It is an added benefit, ensuring that the premiums contribute to future financial goals.

Choosing the right payout option in life insurance plans ensures that your beneficiaries receive the financial support they need in a manner that best suits their requirements.

What is the claim process for life insurance?

Step-by-step guide on the claim process for life insurance in case of death or maturity:

The claim process for life insurance plans varies based on whether the claim is made due to the policyholder's death or at policy maturity.

In case of death:
Notify the insurer: The beneficiary should inform the insurance company about the policyholder’s death as soon as possible, providing details like the policy number and cause of death.
Submit required documents: Key documents include the death certificate, the policy document, a completed claim form, and any other documents requested by the insurer (e.g., medical records, identity proof).
Claim assessment: The insurer reviews the submitted documents and may conduct further investigations if necessary.
Payout: Upon approval, the sum assured is disbursed to the beneficiary, ensuring financial support during a difficult time.
At policy maturity:
Maturity notification: The insurer informs the policyholder about the upcoming maturity and the necessary steps to claim the maturity benefit.
Submit required documents: These include the original policy document, a completed discharge form, and identity proof.
Payout: Once verified, the insurer disburses the maturity amount, which can be used for planned financial goals or retirement.

Understanding the claim process for life insurance plans ensures timely and hassle-free access to benefits when needed.

Which types of death are not covered in life insurance?

Life insurance plans offer financial protection, but certain types of death are typically not covered. Understanding these exclusions is essential to ensure clarity and avoid surprises during claim settlement.

Suicide: Most life insurance plans exclude death by suicide within the first year or two of the policy. This clause is to prevent misuse of the policy.
Self-inflicted injuries: Death resulting from self-inflicted injuries or harm is generally not covered, as these are considered preventable.
Drug or alcohol abuse: If the policyholder's death is due to overdose or complications arising from drug or alcohol abuse, the claim may be denied.
Participation in hazardous activities: Death resulting from participation in dangerous activities like extreme sports or adventure activities may not be covered unless the policy specifically includes such riders.

Understanding these exclusions in life insurance plans helps policyholders ensure they have comprehensive coverage and take necessary steps to mitigate risks. Read the terms and conditions of your life insurance policy to know about the deaths not covered in the policy.
